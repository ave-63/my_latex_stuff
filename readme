Ben's latex packages
====================

bexam - to be used with documentclass exam. Adds title, footers, etc.
boneside & btwosides - Regular article, with nice margins.
bcommon - all include this: includes fonts, etc.

(btwosidesexam - Ignore this. It was an attempt to make my own exam package which used an article documentclass instead. Maybe I'll work on it again someday if there's a reason to.)

**To use:**
1. Put the folders in a directory such as c:\Users\your_name\onedrive\local_tex_stuff\tex\latex. 

2. Run MikTeX Console... Settings... Directories... Add a local TEXMF root directory with path c:\Users\your_name\onedrive\local_tex_stuff. This should make it so that you can use \includepackage{bexam}, and so on.

**Other method: (not tested)**
1. Just put all the .sty files in the same directory as the .tex file you're compiling? I think there's an easy way to do this.
